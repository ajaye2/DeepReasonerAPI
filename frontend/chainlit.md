# Welcome to the Reasoning Chatbot! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

## Overview

The Reasoning Chatbot is an intelligent assistant designed to help you solve problems and answer questions using advanced reasoning techniques. Powered by state-of-the-art AI, this chatbot can analyze your queries and provide insightful responses based on various reasoning algorithms. Whether you're looking for explanations, solutions, or just curious about a topic, our chatbot is here to assist you!

## How to Use the Chatbot

1. **Start a Conversation**: Simply type your question or message in the chat interface. The chatbot is ready to engage with you!

2. **Select a Reasoning Algorithm**: Before you start, you can choose from different reasoning algorithms:
   - **Chain of Thought**: This method breaks down complex problems into simpler steps, allowing for a more structured response.
   - **Reasoning via Planning**: This approach focuses on planning out the steps needed to arrive at a solution, making it ideal for problem-solving scenarios.
   - **Tree of Thought**: This algorithm explores various branches of reasoning, providing a comprehensive view of the topic at hand.

3. **Adjust the Temperature**: You can also set the "Temperature" parameter, which controls the randomness of the chatbot's responses. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.7) will yield more focused and deterministic answers, while a higher temperature (e.g., 1.5) will produce more creative and varied responses.

4. **Receive Responses**: After you send your message, the chatbot will process your input and respond with the best possible answer based on the selected reasoning algorithm and temperature setting.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Be Clear and Specific**: The more specific your question, the better the response you'll receive. Try to provide context if necessary.
- **Experiment with Algorithms**: Feel free to switch between different reasoning algorithms to see which one provides the best answers for your queries.
- **Adjust Temperature as Needed**: Depending on the type of response you want, adjust the temperature to get either more precise or more creative answers.
